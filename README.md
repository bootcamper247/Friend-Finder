### Overview

This is a compatibility-based "FriendFinder" application. This full-stack site takes in results from the users' surveys, then compares their answers with those from other users. The app then displays the name and picture of the user with the best overall match.

### How the App works

1. The survey has 10 questions. Each answer is on a scale of 1 to 5 based on how much the user agrees or disagrees with a question.

2. The app then determines the user's most compatible friend.

3. Once the current user's most compatible friend is matched, the results are displayed as a modal pop-up.
   The modal displays both the name and picture of the closest match.
